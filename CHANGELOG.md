# Changelog

All notable changes to sudosh will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-23
## [2.1.1] - 2025-08-25

### Security
- Redirection: Allow tilde (~) expansion to $HOME as a safe target while continuing to block explicit absolute /root and /var/root. Adds unit test to prevent regression.
- Ansible detection: Treat context_score >= 20 as sufficient when env var hints are present to reduce false negatives in CI-like environments.

### Reliability
- Terminal height: Enforce a sane minimum in get_terminal_height() to avoid flaky pager-related unit tests in CI.

### Docs
- Manpage: Document tilde expansion behavior for redirection security.

### Fixed
- CLI parser regression that broke `--version`; consolidated `--version` and `-V` handling

### Added
- Sudo-compat `-V` version flag support when invoked as `sudo`
- `-p, --prompt` compatibility for custom password prompts

### Tests
- Unit test for prompt setter/getter
- Integration test updates to validate `-p` behavior and keep `-V`/`--version` working

### Docs
- Help text and manpage updated to document `-p/--prompt`; manpage regenerated



### üß∞ CI Hardening & Security Validation
- Build Matrix across Ubuntu and macOS with WERROR, Address/Undefined sanitizers, and coverage
- Stabilized static analysis: cppcheck configured to ignore unmatched suppression noise
- Security regression tests integrated in CI for pipelines and pager protections

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Improvements
- Sudoers parsing: initialize saved_euid to satisfy -Werror under UBSan and ensure proper euid restore
- CI test link fixes: whitelist integrity and pager security tests now link required objects
- Ubuntu WERROR cleanups: check seteuid() return; remove unused variables; safer string handling
