Testing Ctrl-C Line Clearing Feature
====================================

Test 1: Ctrl-C with empty line
------------------------------
sudosh> (simulating empty line)
^C
sudosh> Line cleared by Ctrl-C
Result: pos=0, len=0, buffer=''
Expected: pos=0, len=0, buffer=''
Status: ✅ PASS

Test 2: Ctrl-C with text on line
--------------------------------
sudosh> ls -la /tmp (simulating typed text)
[Ksudosh> Line cleared by Ctrl-C
Result: pos=0, len=0, buffer=''
Expected: pos=0, len=0, buffer=''
Status: ✅ PASS

Test 3: Ctrl-C with partial command
-----------------------------------
sudosh> vi /etc/pass (simulating partial command)
[Ksudosh> Line cleared by Ctrl-C
Result: pos=0, len=0, buffer=''
Expected: pos=0, len=0, buffer=''
Status: ✅ PASS

Test 4: Multiple Ctrl-C presses
-------------------------------
Press 1: sudosh> test command
[Ksudosh> Line cleared by Ctrl-C
Press 2: sudosh> test command
[Ksudosh> Line cleared by Ctrl-C
Press 3: sudosh> test command
[Ksudosh> Line cleared by Ctrl-C
✅ PASS - All presses work correctly

Test 5: Signal flag reset
------------------------
Signal flag set: YES
Signal flag after reset: NO
Status: ✅ PASS

Summary
=======
The Ctrl-C feature provides the following functionality:
✅ Clears current line when Ctrl-C is pressed
✅ Resets cursor position and buffer length
✅ Resets history navigation state
✅ Resets tab completion state
✅ Shows visual feedback (^C for empty line)
✅ Starts fresh prompt after clearing
✅ Handles multiple Ctrl-C presses correctly
✅ Properly resets signal flags

Expected behavior in sudosh:
- User types: 'vi /etc/passwd'
- User presses Ctrl-C
- Line is cleared and fresh prompt appears
- User can start typing new command immediately

This matches standard shell behavior where Ctrl-C
cancels the current line editing and starts fresh.
