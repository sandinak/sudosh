Changes since v2.1.2:
66c1d7f release: bump to v2.1.3 and add scripts/generate_release_report.sh; create reports directory structure for pre-release artifacts
f39b468 sudo-compat: honor global NOPASSWD for command exec; skip auth when euid==0; add regressions for -v and sudo cmd; env_reset orchestration with env_keep whitelist; SSSD NOPASSWD detection helpers; tests green
544efca sudo -l basic: hide group-based privileges (wheel/sudo/admin); show only with -ll. Prepare scaffolding for SSSD option enforcement API.
77f835c repo: clean root artifacts (.gcov, .profraw, pipeline logs); run make clean; prepare for PR
429f2c6 tests(sssd): replace lightweight SSSD stubs with deterministic eval and TLV harness; expand wildcard coverage; cleanup extraneous test files
b35a38f tests(sssd): wildcard host coverage (*.domain, ?? shortnames) and compound TLV harness; all unit tests pass with -Werror
31c3d91 tests(sssd): add deterministic rule-eval test API and suite; cover negative precedence, ALL, order, time, runas; make tests pass under C99 Werror
c864350 tests(sssd): add targeted API invocation tests and C99 mock TLV payload test for parser; keep unit-test green
1d8d1f6 sssd: add runas-aware permission API and initial unit test stub; preserves ABI and tests build
7cded58 sssd: sort rules by sudoOrder; keep negative/positive precedence evaluation stable; build/tests remain green
d505e1e sssd: enforce runas user/group (default root) in rule applicability; keeps build/tests green
b3e604b sssd: add %group support in sudoUser matching; helper for membership; keep warnings clean
a0ea41a sssd: add IPv4/CIDR host matching, host/user/time filters in rule applicability; integrate into permission check; C99 clean
75bf006 sssd(lib): capture runas group, hosts, users, options, order, and time bounds from libsss_sudo; map into local rules; C99 clean
8a81742 sssd: implement negative command precedence and ALL handling in SSSD permission check; groundwork for command list semantics
34aa26c sssd: extend socket TLV parser to collect sudoOption and runas group; include <fnmatch.h> and use glob matching for command patterns; prep for user/host/runas semantics
36a6569 sssd: integrate Phase 1+2 parsing into permission checks; add SSSD command matcher and check_command_permission_sssd; wire into NSS/auth flows; keep C99 clean
0544782 sssd: Phase 1+2 groundwork: expand rule struct; add ctx-based option parsing (noexec,setenv,env_reset,env_keep/check/delete, secure_path, umask, cwd/chroot, iolog*, verifypw, timestamp_timeout, selinux/apparmor); wire into TLV parse (socket + replay). C99 clean.
adcde8a ci(security): also link sssd_replay_dev in pager security test; fix Security Audit linker failure
2eace77 ci(security): link sssd_replay_dev into Security Audit whitelist test to fix undefined reference to parse_and_replay_strace
64d2052 tests(pipeline): link sssd_replay_dev into smoke test to satisfy parse_and_replay_strace; fixes smoke failure in CI
cbec6ff portable: fix getgrouplist prototype differences on macOS vs Linux; CI macOS WERROR now clean
a4f9b87 portable: replace memmem calls with internal sssd_memmem for macOS/clang; fixes macOS build failures under WERROR
cce90f1 Docs: SSSD library-first + segmented socket fallback; env flags; README link. Build: include sssd_test_api in tests. Fix fallback parser scope.
6707bbd SSSD sudo: add segmented socket client + library-first fallback; add TLV parser test helper and unit test; wire tests to build with SUDOSH_TEST_MODE; fix Makefile rules; extensive socket I/O diagnostics. Docs to follow.
