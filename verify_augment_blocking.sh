# Summary

echo "✓ Detects VSCode/Node.js processes in the process tree"
echo "✓ Identifies AI tool execution contexts"
echo "✓ Blocks both single command and interactive modes"
echo "✓ Works alongside existing environment variable detection"
echo "✓ Provides fast detection (< 1 second)"
echo
echo "Key improvements:"
echo "• Augment is now detected even without environment variables"
echo "• Process tree analysis catches AI tools running in development environments"
echo "• Multiple detection methods provide comprehensive coverage"
echo "• Maintains compatibility with existing blocking mechanisms"
