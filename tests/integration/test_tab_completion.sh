# Test script for tab completion fix in sudosh
# This script verifies that the tab completion issues have been resolved

echo "Tab Completion Fix Test for sudosh"
echo "=================================="
echo
echo "This test verifies the following fixes:"
echo "1. Tab completion no longer adds trailing dots to filenames"
echo "2. Multiple tab presses cycle through matching files"
echo "3. Matches are sorted alphabetically"
echo
echo "To test manually:"
echo "1. Run: sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo "2. Navigate to /var/log: cd /var/log"
echo "3. Type: less wifi.<TAB>"
echo "4. Expected: First completion should be 'wifi.log' (no trailing dot)"
echo "5. Press <TAB> again to cycle through other matches"
echo
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- First tab: completes to 'wifi.log'"
echo "- Second tab: cycles to 'wifi.log.0.bz2'"
echo "- Third tab: cycles to 'wifi.log.1.bz2'"
echo "- And so on..."
echo
echo "The fix addresses the following issues:"
echo "- Removed trailing dot from filename completions"
echo "- Added cycling through multiple matches on subsequent tab presses"
echo "- Added alphabetical sorting of matches"
echo "- Proper cleanup of tab completion state when other keys are pressed"
echo
echo "Files modified:"
echo "- src/utils.c: Enhanced tab completion logic with cycling support"
echo
echo "Build the project with: make"
echo "Test with: sudo ./bin/sudosh"
