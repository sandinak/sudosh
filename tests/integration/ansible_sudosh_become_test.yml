          Test Results Summary:
          
          1. Standard sudo whoami: {{ sudo_whoami.stdout }}
          2. Sudosh become whoami: {{ sudosh_whoami.stdout }}
          3. Sudosh become id: {{ sudosh_id.stdout }}
          4. File creation: {{ test_file_stat.stat.exists }}
          5. Package operation: {{ sudosh_package.changed | default('failed') }}
          6. Service operation: {{ sudosh_service.changed | default('failed') }}
          
          Environment Variables Detected:

          Test Status: {% if sudo_whoami.stdout == sudosh_whoami.stdout %}SUCCESS{% else %}FAILED{% endif %}
          
          Notes:
          - Sudosh become method should produce same results as sudo
          - Additional logging and detection should be visible in system logs
          - Environment variables should show Ansible context
