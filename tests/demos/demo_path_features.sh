# Demonstration script for PATH command and validation features

echo "PATH Command and Validation Features Demonstration"
echo "=================================================="
echo
echo "This script demonstrates the new PATH analysis capabilities"
echo "added to sudosh."
echo

# Check if sudosh is built
if [ ! -f "./bin/sudosh" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: sudosh binary not found. Please run 'make' first."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ sudosh binary found"

# Check if path-validator is built
if [ ! -f "./bin/path-validator" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: path-validator binary not found. Please run 'make' first."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ path-validator binary found"
echo

echo "Feature Overview:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. Built-in 'path' command in sudosh"
echo "   - Displays current PATH environment variable"
echo "   - Shows numbered list of PATH directories"
echo "   - Checks each directory for existence and accessibility"
echo "   - Performs comprehensive security analysis"
echo "   - Provides recommendations for fixing issues"
echo
echo "2. Standalone path-validator tool"
echo "   - Can validate any PATH string"
echo "   - Multiple operation modes (validate, clean, fix)"
echo "   - Scriptable with exit codes"
echo "   - Can be used independently of sudosh"
echo

echo "Security Issues Detected:"
echo "========================="
echo "• Current directory (.) in PATH"
echo "• Empty directories (::) in PATH"
echo "• Relative paths in PATH"
echo "• Non-existent directories"
echo "• Non-directory entries"
echo

echo "Built-in Command Usage:"
echo "======================="
echo "Within sudosh, simply type:"
echo "  sudosh> path"
echo
echo "This will display:"
echo "• Current PATH value"
echo "• Numbered directory list with status"
echo "• Security analysis results"
echo "• Recommendations for improvements"
echo

echo "Standalone Tool Usage:"
echo "======================"
echo "The path-validator tool can be used in several ways:"
echo
echo "1. Basic validation:"
echo "   ./bin/path-validator"
echo
echo "2. Quiet mode (for scripts):"
echo "   ./bin/path-validator -q"
echo "   echo \$?  # 0 = secure, 1 = issues found"
echo
echo "3. Show cleaned PATH:"
echo "   ./bin/path-validator -c"
echo
echo "4. Fix PATH in environment:"
echo "   ./bin/path-validator -f"
echo
echo "5. Validate specific PATH:"
echo "   ./bin/path-validator -p \"/bin:/usr/bin:.\""
echo

echo "Example Demonstrations:"
echo "======================="
echo

echo "Demo 1: Secure PATH"
echo "-------------------"
echo "Testing a secure PATH configuration:"
SECURE_PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
echo "PATH: $SECURE_PATH"
echo
echo "Running: ./bin/path-validator -p \"$SECURE_PATH\""
./bin/path-validator -p "$SECURE_PATH"
echo "Exit code: $?"
echo

echo "Demo 2: Insecure PATH with current directory"
echo "--------------------------------------------"
echo "Testing PATH with current directory (security issue):"
INSECURE_PATH="/usr/bin:.:/bin"
echo "PATH: $INSECURE_PATH"
echo
echo "Running: ./bin/path-validator -p \"$INSECURE_PATH\""
./bin/path-validator -p "$INSECURE_PATH"
echo "Exit code: $?"
echo

echo "Demo 3: PATH with multiple issues"
echo "---------------------------------"
echo "Testing PATH with multiple security issues:"
MULTI_ISSUE_PATH="/usr/bin:.:/bin::relative/path"
echo "PATH: $MULTI_ISSUE_PATH"
echo
echo "Running: ./bin/path-validator -p \"$MULTI_ISSUE_PATH\""
./bin/path-validator -p "$MULTI_ISSUE_PATH"
echo "Exit code: $?"
echo

echo "Demo 4: Cleaned PATH output"
echo "---------------------------"
echo "Showing how the tool can clean an insecure PATH:"
echo "Original PATH: $MULTI_ISSUE_PATH"
echo
echo "Running: ./bin/path-validator -c -p \"$MULTI_ISSUE_PATH\""
CLEANED_PATH=$(./bin/path-validator -c -p "$MULTI_ISSUE_PATH")
echo "Cleaned PATH: $CLEANED_PATH"
echo

echo "Demo 5: Quiet mode for scripting"
echo "--------------------------------"
echo "Demonstrating quiet mode for use in scripts:"
echo
echo "Testing secure PATH:"
./bin/path-validator -q -p "$SECURE_PATH"
echo "Exit code: $? (0 = secure)"
echo
echo "Testing insecure PATH:"
./bin/path-validator -q -p "$INSECURE_PATH"
echo "Exit code: $? (1 = issues found)"
echo

echo "Integration with sudosh:"
echo "========================"
echo "The 'path' command is fully integrated with sudosh:"
echo
echo "• Added to help system (help command shows it)"
echo "• Added to commands list (commands command shows it)"
echo "• Added to tab completion (type 'pa<TAB>' to complete)"
echo "• Follows sudosh's built-in command conventions"
echo

echo "Manual Testing Instructions:"
echo "============================"
echo "To test the built-in command manually:"
echo
echo "1. Start sudosh:"
echo "   sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo
echo "2. Use the path command:"
echo "   sudosh> path"
echo
echo "3. Try tab completion:"
echo "   sudosh> pa<TAB>  # Should complete to 'path'"
echo
echo "4. Check help system:"
echo "   sudosh> help     # Should list 'path' command"
echo
echo "5. Test with different PATH values:"
echo "   sudosh> exit"
echo "   export PATH=\"/usr/bin:.:/bin\""
echo "   sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo "   sudosh> path     # Should show security issues"
echo

echo "Security Benefits:"
echo "=================="
echo "✅ Immediate visibility into PATH security issues"
echo "✅ Educational - explains why issues are dangerous"
echo "✅ Actionable - provides specific fix recommendations"
echo "✅ Automated - can be used in scripts and monitoring"
echo "✅ Comprehensive - detects multiple types of issues"
echo "✅ Safe - read-only analysis, no system modifications"
echo

echo "Use Cases:"
echo "=========="
echo "• Security auditing and compliance checking"
echo "• System administration and troubleshooting"
echo "• Educational tool for understanding PATH security"
echo "• Automated monitoring and alerting"
echo "• Configuration management validation"
echo "• Incident response and forensics"
echo

echo "Common Secure PATH Examples:"
echo "============================"
echo "Standard Linux system:"
echo "  /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
echo
echo "With user local binaries:"
echo "  /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/home/user/.local/bin"
echo
echo "Minimal secure PATH:"
echo "  /usr/bin:/bin"
echo
echo "Server environment:"
echo "  /usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
echo

echo "Conclusion:"
echo "==========="
echo "The PATH command and validation features provide comprehensive"
echo "PATH security analysis for sudosh users. They offer both"
echo "interactive convenience and automation capabilities."
echo
echo "Key features implemented:"
echo "• Built-in 'path' command for interactive use"
echo "• Standalone path-validator tool for automation"
echo "• Comprehensive security analysis"
echo "• Clear recommendations and examples"
echo "• Full integration with sudosh"
echo
echo "🎉 PATH features are ready for production use!"
