# Demonstration script for Ctrl-C line clearing feature

echo "Ctrl-C Line Clearing Feature Demonstration"
echo "=========================================="
echo
echo "This script demonstrates the new Ctrl-C line clearing functionality"
echo "that has been added to sudosh."
echo

# Check if sudosh is built
if [ ! -f "./bin/sudosh" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: sudosh binary not found. Please run 'make' first."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ sudosh binary found"
echo

echo "Feature Overview:"
echo "=================="
echo "The Ctrl-C line clearing feature provides standard CLI behavior where"
echo "pressing Ctrl-C cancels the current line editing and starts fresh."
echo

echo "Behavior:"
echo "---------"
echo "1. User types a command (e.g., 'vi /etc/passwd')"
echo "2. User presses Ctrl-C before hitting Enter"
echo "3. Current line is cleared and cursor resets"
echo "4. Fresh prompt appears immediately"
echo "5. User can start typing a new command"
echo

echo "Implementation Details:"
echo "======================="
echo "• Uses existing SIGINT signal handling infrastructure"
echo "• Clears line buffer and resets cursor position"
echo "• Resets history navigation and tab completion state"
echo "• Uses ANSI escape sequences for terminal control"
echo "• Provides visual feedback (^C for empty lines)"
echo

echo "Code Location:"
echo "=============="
echo "• File: src/utils.c"
echo "• Function: read_command()"
echo "• Lines: 554-580"
echo

echo "Signal Handling:"
echo "================"
echo "• SIGINT (Ctrl-C): Clears current line, starts fresh"
echo "• SIGTERM/SIGQUIT: Graceful shutdown with cleanup"
echo "• SIGTSTP (Ctrl-Z): Ignored (prevents suspension)"
echo "• Child processes: Receive signals normally"
echo

echo "Testing the Feature:"
echo "==================="
echo "To test this feature manually:"
echo
echo "1. Start sudosh:"
echo "   sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo
echo "2. Type a command but don't press Enter:"
echo "   sudosh> vi /etc/passwd"
echo
echo "3. Press Ctrl-C:"
echo "   Expected result: Line clears, fresh prompt appears"
echo
echo "4. Try with empty line:"
echo "   sudosh> <Ctrl-C>"
echo "   Expected result: Shows ^C and new prompt"
echo
echo "5. Test multiple Ctrl-C presses:"
echo "   Each Ctrl-C should clear the current line"
echo

echo "Benefits:"
echo "========="
echo "✅ Standard shell behavior - matches bash, zsh expectations"
echo "✅ Quick recovery from typing mistakes"
echo "✅ Easy cancellation of complex commands"
echo "✅ No need to backspace through long commands"
echo "✅ Clean state management - resets all input state"
echo "✅ No security impact - maintains all protections"
echo

echo "Compatibility:"
echo "=============="
echo "✅ Works with all ANSI-compatible terminals"
echo "✅ Compatible with existing signal handling"
echo "✅ No interference with child process signals"
echo "✅ Works with tab completion and history navigation"
echo "✅ Integrates with file locking and secure editors"
echo

echo "Technical Implementation:"
echo "========================"
echo "The feature leverages sudosh's existing signal handling:"
echo
echo "1. Signal Detection:"
echo "   - received_sigint_signal() checks for Ctrl-C"
echo "   - reset_sigint_flag() clears the signal flag"
echo
echo "2. Line Clearing:"
echo "   - \\r moves cursor to beginning of line"
echo "   - \\033[K clears from cursor to end of line"
echo "   - print_prompt() shows fresh prompt"
echo
echo "3. State Reset:"
echo "   - memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer)) clears input"
echo "   - pos = 0, len = 0 resets position tracking"
echo "   - history_index = -1 resets history navigation"
echo "   - cleanup_tab_completion() resets tab state"
echo

echo "Security Considerations:"
echo "========================"
echo "✅ No security impact - feature only affects line editing"
echo "✅ Does not bypass authentication or authorization"
echo "✅ Does not interfere with audit logging"
echo "✅ Maintains signal handling for child processes"
echo "✅ Does not affect command execution security"
echo

echo "User Experience Examples:"
echo "========================="
echo
echo "Example 1 - Cancel long command:"
echo "sudosh> find / -name '*.conf' -type f -exec grep -l 'password' {} \\;<Ctrl-C>"
echo "sudosh> "
echo
echo "Example 2 - Fix typo quickly:"
echo "sudosh> vi /etc/paswd<Ctrl-C>"
echo "sudosh> vi /etc/passwd"
echo
echo "Example 3 - Empty line:"
echo "sudosh> <Ctrl-C>"
echo "^C"
echo "sudosh> "
echo

echo "Integration with Other Features:"
echo "==============================="
echo "The Ctrl-C feature works seamlessly with:"
echo "• Command history (Up/Down arrows)"
echo "• Tab completion (Tab key)"
echo "• Line editing (Left/Right arrows, Home/End)"
echo "• Secure editor functionality"
echo "• File locking system"
echo "• Authentication and authorization"
echo "• Audit logging and session recording"
echo

echo "Conclusion:"
echo "==========="
echo "The Ctrl-C line clearing feature enhances sudosh's usability by"
echo "providing standard CLI behavior that users expect. It allows quick"
echo "cancellation of command input without affecting security or existing"
echo "functionality."
echo
echo "This feature makes sudosh feel more natural and responsive, improving"
echo "the overall user experience while maintaining all security protections."
echo
echo "🎉 Feature is ready for production use!"
