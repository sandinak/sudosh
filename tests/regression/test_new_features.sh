# Test script for new sudosh features
# This script documents and tests the new = expansion and secure vi features

echo "New Features Test for sudosh"
echo "============================"
echo
echo "This test documents the following new features:"
echo "1. = expansion (like zsh) for command path resolution"
echo "2. Secure vi/vim execution with container-like restrictions"
echo "3. Built-in 'version' command (same output as --version)"
echo
echo "Feature 1: = Expansion"
echo "====================="
echo
echo "The = expansion feature allows you to expand command names to their full paths,"
echo "similar to zsh's = expansion functionality."
echo
echo "Examples:"
echo "- 'vi =ls' expands to 'vi /bin/ls'"
echo "- '=cat file.txt' expands to '/bin/cat file.txt'"
echo "- 'less =vi' expands to 'less /usr/bin/vi'"
echo
echo "Tab completion also works with = expansion:"
echo "- Type '=l<TAB>' to see all commands starting with 'l'"
echo "- Type '=vi<TAB>' to complete to the full path of vi"
echo
echo "How it works:"
echo "- When sudosh encounters an argument starting with '=', it searches PATH"
echo "- It finds the first executable matching the name after the '='"
echo "- It replaces the =command with the full path"
echo "- If no match is found, the original =command is left unchanged"
echo
echo "Feature 2: Secure vi/vim Execution"
echo "=================================="
echo
echo "Previously, vi/vim were completely blocked due to shell escape capabilities."
echo "Now, vi/vim/nano/pico can be run with security restrictions:"
echo
echo "Allowed editors (with restrictions):"
echo "- vi, vim, view"
echo "- nano, pico"
echo
echo "Still blocked editors (too dangerous):"
echo "- nvim (too many shell escape features)"
echo "- emacs (can execute arbitrary code)"
echo "- joe, mcedit, ed, ex (shell escape capabilities)"
echo
echo "Security restrictions applied to allowed editors:"
echo "- SHELL environment variable set to /bin/false"
echo "- VISUAL and EDITOR set to /bin/false"
echo "- VIMINIT set to 'set nomodeline noexrc secure'"
echo "- PAGER and MANPAGER set to /bin/false"
echo "- Dangerous vim/vi configuration variables removed"
echo "- Restrictive umask (0077) applied"
echo
echo "This prevents common shell escape methods:"
echo "- :!command (shell command execution)"
echo "- :shell (spawning a shell)"
echo "- External program execution through pagers"
echo "- Configuration file exploits"
echo
echo "Testing Instructions:"
echo "===================="
echo
echo "To test = expansion:"
echo "1. Run: sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo "2. Try: echo =ls"
echo "3. Expected: Should show the full path to ls"
echo "4. Try: =l<TAB> (tab completion)"
echo "5. Expected: Should show all commands starting with 'l'"
echo
echo "To test secure vi:"
echo "1. Run: sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo "2. Try: vi /tmp/test.txt"
echo "3. Expected: vi should open normally"
echo "4. In vi, try: :!ls"
echo "5. Expected: Should fail or show error (shell blocked)"
echo "6. Try: :shell"
echo "7. Expected: Should fail (shell blocked)"
echo
echo "To test blocked editors:"
echo "1. Run: sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo "2. Try: emacs /tmp/test.txt"
echo "3. Expected: Should be blocked with security message"
echo "4. Try: nvim /tmp/test.txt"
echo "5. Expected: Should be blocked with security message"
echo
echo "To test version command:"
echo "1. Test command line: ./bin/sudosh --version"
echo "2. Expected: Should show 'sudosh 1.8.0'"
echo "3. Run: sudo ./bin/sudosh"
echo "4. Try: version"
echo "5. Expected: Should show 'sudosh 1.8.0' (same as step 2)"
echo "6. Try: help"
echo "7. Expected: Should list 'version' as an available command"
echo
echo "Implementation Details:"
echo "======================"
echo
echo "Files modified:"
echo "- src/utils.c: Added complete_equals_expansion() function"
echo "- src/command.c: Added expand_equals_expression() function"
echo "- src/security.c: Added is_secure_editor() and setup_secure_editor_environment()"
echo "- src/security.c: Modified is_interactive_editor() to exclude secure editors"
echo "- src/sudosh.h: Added function declarations"
echo
echo "Key functions:"
echo "- complete_equals_expansion(): Handles tab completion for = expressions"
echo "- expand_equals_expression(): Expands =command to full path during parsing"
echo "- is_secure_editor(): Identifies editors that can be run securely"
echo "- setup_secure_editor_environment(): Sets up restricted environment"
echo
echo "Security considerations:"
echo "- = expansion only works with executable files in PATH"
echo "- Secure editors run with heavily restricted environment"
echo "- All shell escape vectors are blocked or disabled"
echo "- Audit logging tracks all editor usage"
echo
echo "Feature 3: Built-in Version Command"
echo "==================================="
echo
echo "Added a 'version' built-in command that provides the same output as --version."
echo
echo "Usage:"
echo "- Command line: ./bin/sudosh --version"
echo "- Built-in command: version (from within sudosh)"
echo
echo "Both produce identical output: 'sudosh 1.8.0'"
echo
echo "The version command is also listed in the help output when you type 'help' or '?'"
echo
echo "Implementation:"
echo "- Added to handle_builtin_command() in src/utils.c"
echo "- Updated print_help() to include version in command list"
echo "- Uses same SUDOSH_VERSION constant as --version option"
echo
echo "Build the project with: make"
echo "Test with: sudo ./bin/sudosh"
