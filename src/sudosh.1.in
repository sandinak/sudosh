.SH NAME
sudosh \- interactive sudo shell with comprehensive logging
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sudosh
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.br
.B sudosh
[\fB\-l\fR \fIFILE\fR] [\fB\-h\fR] [\fB\-v\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sudosh
is an interactive sudo shell that provides a command prompt for executing privileged commands with comprehensive logging to syslog. It uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for secure user authentication and logs all commands in the same format as sudo.

Unlike traditional sudo which executes single commands, sudosh provides an interactive shell session where multiple commands can be executed with elevated privileges while maintaining full audit trails.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-l " \fIFILE\fR, " \-\-log\-session " \fIFILE\fR"
Log the entire session (input and output) to the specified file. This creates a detailed log of all commands entered and their output with timestamps.

.SH USAGE
When started, sudosh performs the following steps:
.IP 1. 4
Checks if the current user has sudo privileges (member of wheel or sudo group)
.IP 2. 4
Prompts for password authentication via PAM
.IP 3. 4
Provides an interactive shell prompt with color support: \fBuser@hostname:/current/directory##\fR
.IP 4. 4
Logs all commands and authentication attempts to syslog
.IP 5. 4
Automatically logs command history to ~/.sudosh_history with timestamps

.SH LOGGING FEATURES
sudosh provides comprehensive logging capabilities:

.SS Syslog Integration
All authentication attempts, commands, and security events are logged to syslog with detailed information including hostname, TTY, working directory, and timestamps.

.SS Command History
All commands executed in sudosh are automatically logged to \fB~/.sudosh_history\fR with timestamps. This file is created with 0600 permissions (readable/writable by owner only) for security.

.SS Session Logging
When the \fB-l\fR option is used, sudosh logs the complete session including all input and output to the specified file. This creates a detailed transcript of the entire session with timestamps.

.SH SECURITY FEATURES
.SS Authentication Caching
sudosh implements secure authentication caching similar to sudo:
.IP \(bu 4
Successful authentications are cached for 15 minutes by default
.IP \(bu 4
Cache files are stored in /var/run/sudosh with strict permissions (0600, root-owned)
.IP \(bu 4
Separate cache files per user and TTY for security isolation
.IP \(bu 4
Expired cache files are automatically cleaned up
.IP \(bu 4
Failed authentications invalidate existing cache entries

.SS Environment Sanitization
sudosh removes dangerous environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD, CDPATH, and others that could be used for privilege escalation attacks. It sets a secure PATH and appropriate umask.

.SS Command Validation
All commands are validated for security issues including:
.IP \(bu 4
Null byte injection attempts
.IP \(bu 4
Excessive command length
.IP \(bu 4
Path traversal attempts (../)
.IP \(bu 4
Shell command blocking (bash, sh, zsh, etc.)
.IP \(bu 4
Dangerous command detection with user confirmation prompts

.SS Intelligent Gut Check Commands
sudosh implements intelligent "gut check" warnings that distinguish between safe and dangerous operations. The system now intelligently analyzes commands to reduce false positives while maintaining security:

.B Safe Read-Only Operations (No Warning):
.IP \(bu 4
.B cat, less, more, head, tail, view, vi, vim, nano
- File viewing and editing commands on system files
.IP \(bu 4
.B ls, find, locate, grep
- File listing and searching commands
.IP \(bu 4
.B ps, top, htop, id, whoami, date, uptime
- System information commands

.B Dangerous Operations (Warning Required):
.IP \(bu 4
.B Output redirection to system directories
- Commands like "echo text > /etc/passwd" or "cat file >> /etc/hosts"
.IP \(bu 4
.B Pipes to dangerous commands
- Commands like "cat /etc/passwd | rm /etc/hosts"

.B Dangerous System Commands:
.IP \(bu 4
.B init, shutdown, halt, reboot, poweroff
- System control commands
.IP \(bu 4
.B systemctl poweroff, systemctl reboot, systemctl halt
- Systemd power management
.IP \(bu 4
.B systemctl emergency, systemctl rescue
- Emergency system modes

.B Dangerous Command Flags:
.IP \(bu 4
.B rm -rf, rm -R
- Recursive file removal
.IP \(bu 4
.B chmod -R, chmod --recursive
- Recursive permission changes
.IP \(bu 4
.B chown -R, chown --recursive
- Recursive ownership changes
.IP \(bu 4
.B chgrp -R, chgrp --recursive
- Recursive group changes

.B Critical System Directory Access:
.IP \(bu 4
.B /dev/*
- Device files and hardware interfaces
.IP \(bu 4
.B /proc/*
- Process and kernel information
.IP \(bu 4
.B /sys/*
- System and kernel parameters

When these commands are detected, sudosh displays a warning message and prompts for explicit confirmation with "yes" before proceeding. This helps prevent accidental execution of potentially destructive operations.

.SS Privilege Management
.IP \(bu 4
Requires setuid root or running as root
.IP \(bu 4
Proper privilege escalation for command execution
.IP \(bu 4
Signal handling for clean shutdown

.SS Authentication
.IP \(bu 4
PAM-based authentication
.IP \(bu 4
Group membership validation (wheel/sudo groups)
.IP \(bu 4
Failed authentication logging

.SH LOGGING
All sudosh activity is logged to syslog with facility LOG_AUTHPRIV. Log entries include:
.IP \(bu 4
Authentication attempts (success/failure)
.IP \(bu 4
Session start/end events
.IP \(bu 4
Command executions with full context (TTY, PWD, USER, COMMAND)
.IP \(bu 4
Security violations

Log format matches sudo for compatibility with existing log analysis tools:
.nf
username : TTY=tty ; PWD=directory ; USER=root ; COMMAND=command
.fi

.SH COLOR SUPPORT
sudosh automatically inherits and applies colors from the calling shell's environment to provide a familiar user experience.

.SS Automatic Color Detection
sudosh detects terminal color capabilities by examining:
.IP \(bu 4
.B TERM
environment variable (e.g., xterm-256color, screen, tmux)
.IP \(bu 4
.B COLORTERM
environment variable (e.g., truecolor, 24bit)
.IP \(bu 4
TTY status to ensure colors are only applied to interactive terminals

.SS PS1 Color Inheritance
Colors are extracted from the calling shell's PS1 environment variable:
.IP \(bu 4
Supports standard bash color formats: \\[\\033[...m\\]
.IP \(bu 4
Supports alternative formats: \\[\\e[...m\\]
.IP \(bu 4
Applies colors to username, hostname, and path components
.IP \(bu 4
Maintains color consistency with the original shell prompt

.SS Environment Preservation
Color-related environment variables are preserved during security sanitization:
.IP \(bu 4
PS1 (shell prompt with color codes)
.IP \(bu 4
TERM (terminal type)
.IP \(bu 4
COLORTERM (color capability indicator)
.IP \(bu 4
LS_COLORS (directory listing colors)
.IP \(bu 4
GREP_COLORS (grep output colors)

.SS Graceful Fallback
When colors are not supported or detected:
.IP \(bu 4
Falls back to plain text prompt
.IP \(bu 4
Maintains full functionality without colors
.IP \(bu 4
No error messages or warnings displayed

.SH CONFIGURATION
sudosh uses the system's PAM configuration. It attempts to use the "sudo" PAM service, which typically inherits from the system authentication configuration.

On systems without PAM support, sudosh falls back to mock authentication for demonstration purposes.
