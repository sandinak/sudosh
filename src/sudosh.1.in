.SH NAME
sudosh \- interactive sudo shell with comprehensive logging
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sudosh
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.br
.B sudosh
[\fB\-l\fR \fIFILE\fR] [\fB\-h\fR] [\fB\-v\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sudosh
is an interactive sudo shell that provides a command prompt for executing privileged commands with comprehensive logging to syslog. It uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for secure user authentication and logs all commands in the same format as sudo.

Unlike traditional sudo which executes single commands, sudosh provides an interactive shell session where multiple commands can be executed with elevated privileges while maintaining full audit trails.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-l " \fIFILE\fR, " \-\-log\-session " \fIFILE\fR"
Log the entire session (input and output) to the specified file. This creates a detailed log of all commands entered and their output with timestamps.

.SH USAGE
When started, sudosh performs the following steps:
.IP 1. 4
Checks if the current user has sudo privileges (member of wheel or sudo group)
.IP 2. 4
Prompts for password authentication via PAM
.IP 3. 4
Provides an interactive shell prompt: \fBsudosh:/current/directory#\fR
.IP 4. 4
Logs all commands and authentication attempts to syslog
.IP 5. 4
Automatically logs command history to ~/.sudosh_history with timestamps

.B cd \fI[directory]\fR
Change the current working directory. If no directory is specified, changes to the user's home directory.
.TP
.B pwd

.SH LOGGING FEATURES
sudosh provides comprehensive logging capabilities:

.SS Syslog Integration
All authentication attempts, commands, and security events are logged to syslog with detailed information including hostname, TTY, working directory, and timestamps.

.SS Command History
All commands executed in sudosh are automatically logged to \fB~/.sudosh_history\fR with timestamps. This file is created with 0600 permissions (readable/writable by owner only) for security.

.SS Session Logging
When the \fB-l\fR option is used, sudosh logs the complete session including all input and output to the specified file. This creates a detailed transcript of the entire session with timestamps.

.SH SECURITY FEATURES
.SS Environment Sanitization
sudosh removes dangerous environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD, CDPATH, and others that could be used for privilege escalation attacks. It sets a secure PATH and appropriate umask.

.SS Command Validation
All commands are validated for security issues including:
.IP \(bu 4
Null byte injection attempts
.IP \(bu 4
Excessive command length
.IP \(bu 4
Path traversal attempts (../)
.IP \(bu 4
Shell command blocking (bash, sh, zsh, etc.)
.IP \(bu 4
Dangerous command detection with user confirmation prompts

.SS Gut Check Commands
sudosh implements "gut check" warnings for potentially dangerous commands that require user confirmation before execution:

.B Dangerous System Commands:
.IP \(bu 4
.B init, shutdown, halt, reboot, poweroff
- System control commands
.IP \(bu 4
.B systemctl poweroff, systemctl reboot, systemctl halt
- Systemd power management
.IP \(bu 4
.B systemctl emergency, systemctl rescue
- Emergency system modes

.B Dangerous Command Flags:
.IP \(bu 4
.B rm -rf, rm -R
- Recursive file removal
.IP \(bu 4
.B chmod -R, chmod --recursive
- Recursive permission changes
.IP \(bu 4
.B chown -R, chown --recursive
- Recursive ownership changes
.IP \(bu 4
.B chgrp -R, chgrp --recursive
- Recursive group changes

.B Critical System Directory Access:
.IP \(bu 4
.B /dev/*
- Device files and hardware interfaces
.IP \(bu 4
.B /proc/*
- Process and kernel information
.IP \(bu 4
.B /sys/*
- System and kernel parameters

When these commands are detected, sudosh displays a warning message and prompts for explicit confirmation with "yes" before proceeding. This helps prevent accidental execution of potentially destructive operations.

.SS Privilege Management
.IP \(bu 4
Requires setuid root or running as root
.IP \(bu 4
Proper privilege escalation for command execution
.IP \(bu 4
Signal handling for clean shutdown

.SS Authentication
.IP \(bu 4
PAM-based authentication
.IP \(bu 4
Group membership validation (wheel/sudo groups)
.IP \(bu 4
Failed authentication logging

.SH LOGGING
All sudosh activity is logged to syslog with facility LOG_AUTHPRIV. Log entries include:
.IP \(bu 4
Authentication attempts (success/failure)
.IP \(bu 4
Session start/end events
.IP \(bu 4
Command executions with full context (TTY, PWD, USER, COMMAND)
.IP \(bu 4
Security violations

Log format matches sudo for compatibility with existing log analysis tools:
.nf
username : TTY=tty ; PWD=directory ; USER=root ; COMMAND=command
.fi

.SH CONFIGURATION
sudosh uses the system's PAM configuration. It attempts to use the "sudo" PAM service, which typically inherits from the system authentication configuration.

On systems without PAM support, sudosh falls back to mock authentication for demonstration purposes.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/pam.d/sudo
PAM configuration file used by sudosh
.TP
.I /etc/group
Group membership file (wheel/sudo groups)
.TP
.I /var/log/auth.log
Authentication log file (Debian/Ubuntu)
.TP
.I /var/log/secure
Security log file (Red Hat/CentOS)

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success
.TP
.B 1
General failure
.TP
.B 2
Authentication failure
.TP
.B 127
Command not found

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.IP \(bu 4
sudosh should only be used in trusted environments
.IP \(bu 4
Regular security audits are recommended
.IP \(bu 4
Monitor logs for suspicious activity
.IP \(bu 4
Keep the system and dependencies updated
.IP \(bu 4
The binary must be installed with setuid root permissions for production use

.SH INSTALLATION
To install sudosh with proper permissions:
.nf
make
sudo make install
.fi

This installs the binary to /usr/local/bin/sudosh with setuid root permissions.

.SH VIEWING LOGS
To view sudosh logs:
.nf
# On systems with journald
sudo journalctl -t sudosh

# On systems with traditional syslog
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/secure
.fi

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.SS Permission Denied
Ensure sudosh is installed with setuid root:
.nf
ls -l /usr/local/bin/sudosh
# Should show: -rwsr-xr-x ... root root ... sudosh
.fi

.SS Authentication Issues
Check PAM configuration:
.nf
ls /etc/pam.d/sudo
.fi

.SS User Not in Sudoers
Add user to appropriate group:
.nf
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo usermod -aG sudo username

# Red Hat/CentOS
sudo usermod -aG wheel username
.fi
