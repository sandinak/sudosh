.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sudosh
is a secure interactive sudo shell that provides both interactive sessions and single-command execution with comprehensive logging, intelligent shell redirection, and advanced security protections. It uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for secure user authentication and logs all commands in the same format as sudo.

.B sudosh v2.0
introduces intelligent shell redirection when aliased to 'sudo', enhanced text processing with awk/sed support, comprehensive rules display, and improved pipeline security. It can serve as a drop-in replacement for sudo in many scenarios while providing superior security controls and audit capabilities.

Unlike traditional sudo which executes single commands, sudosh provides an interactive shell session where multiple commands can be executed with elevated privileges while maintaining full audit trails and advanced security protections. When users attempt shell commands through sudo aliases, sudosh provides educational guidance and seamlessly transitions them to a secure interactive environment.

.B sudosh
includes protection against recent CVE vulnerabilities including CVE-2023-22809 (sudoedit privilege escalation), CVE-2022-3715 (bash heap buffer overflow), and various Shellshock variants. It features enhanced environment sanitization, null byte injection detection, comprehensive command validation, and intelligent security messaging to prevent exploits while educating users.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-\-build\-info
Display detailed build information and exit. Shows the version, git commit, build date (UTC), and build user. Useful for support and reproducibility.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Enable verbose output including privilege detection details.
.TP
.BR \-c " \fICOMMAND\fR"
Execute the specified command and exit. This allows sudosh to be used as a drop-in replacement for sudo in many scenarios. When sudosh is aliased to 'sudo' and users attempt shell commands (bash, sh, zsh, etc.), intelligent redirection provides educational guidance and transitions to interactive mode.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-list
List available commands from sudoers configuration with comprehensive source attribution. This option provides detailed analysis of sudo permissions similar to \fBsudo -l\fR but with enhanced source tracking. The output includes:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDefaults Configuration\fR: Shows sudo defaults that apply to the user
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDirect Sudoers Rules\fR: Explicit rules for the specific user with source file paths
.IP \(bu 2
\fBGroup-Based Privileges\fR: Shows admin groups the user belongs to
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSystem-Wide Group Rules\fR: Sudoers rules that apply to groups the user is in
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSummary\fR: Clear indication of privilege types and authorization status
.RE
Each permission entry includes the specific file path where the rule is defined, making it easy to identify which sudoers file to modify for specific permissions.
.TP
.BR \-L " \fIFILE\fR, " \-\-log\-session " \fIFILE\fR"
Log the entire session (input and output) to the specified file. This creates a detailed log of all commands entered and their output with timestamps.
.TP
.BR \-u " \fIUSER\fR, " \-\-user " \fIUSER\fR"
Run commands as the specified target user (requires sudoers permission).
.TP
.BR \-\-ansible\-detect
Enable Ansible session detection (default). When enabled, sudosh automatically detects if it's being called from an Ansible automation session and adjusts logging and behavior accordingly.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-ansible\-detect
Disable Ansible session detection. This prevents sudosh from attempting to detect Ansible sessions and treats all sessions as regular interactive sessions.
.TP
.BR \-\-ansible\-force
Force Ansible session mode regardless of detection results. This option enables Ansible detection and forces sudosh to treat the session as an Ansible automation session.
.TP
.BR \-\-ansible\-verbose
Enable verbose output for Ansible detection. This provides detailed information about the detection process, including confidence levels and detection methods used.

.SS Sudo Compatibility Mode
When invoked as \fBsudo\fP (i.e., the program name is \fBsudo\fP), sudosh enables a
"sudo-compat" mode that accepts a subset of sudo-style options while retaining sudosh
security policies (no direct shells, sanitized environment, restricted redirection/pipelines).
.TP
.BR -V
Print version (same as --version) and exit.
.TP
.BR -v
Validate/update authentication timestamp (refresh cache) and exit.
.TP
.BR -k
Invalidate cached authentication and exit.
.TP
.BR -n
Non-interactive mode. Refuse authentication prompts and fail if authentication would be required.
.TP
.B \fIcommand\fP
Execute single command under sudosh validation.
.TP
.BR -u " \fIUSER\fP " \fIcommand...\fP
Run command as target user under sudosh validation.
.PP
Many sudo flags are intentionally unsupported for security (-E, -H, -i, -s, etc.).
Use \fB--verbose\fP (not \fB-v\fP) to enable verbose logging while in compat mode.

.SH LOGGING FEATURES
sudosh provides comprehensive logging capabilities:

.SS Syslog Integration
All authentication attempts, commands, and security events are logged to syslog with detailed information including hostname, TTY, working directory, and timestamps.

.SS Command History
All commands executed in sudosh are automatically logged to \fB~/.sudosh_history\fR with timestamps. This file is created with 0600 permissions (readable/writable by owner only) for security.

.SS Session Logging
When the \fB-l\fR option is used, sudosh logs the complete session including all input and output to the specified file. This creates a detailed transcript of the entire session with timestamps.

.SH SECURITY FEATURES
.SS Authentication Caching
sudosh implements secure authentication caching similar to sudo:
.IP \(bu 4
Successful authentications are cached for 15 minutes by default
.IP \(bu 4
Cache files are stored in /var/run/sudosh with strict permissions (0600, root-owned)
.IP \(bu 4
Separate cache files per user and TTY for security isolation
.IP \(bu 4
Expired cache files are automatically cleaned up
.IP \(bu 4
Failed authentications invalidate existing cache entries

.SS Environment Sanitization
sudosh removes dangerous environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD, CDPATH, and others that could be used for privilege escalation attacks. It sets a secure PATH and appropriate umask.

.SS Command Validation
All commands are validated for security issues including:
.IP \(bu 4
Null byte injection attempts
.IP \(bu 4
Excessive command length
.IP \(bu 4
Path traversal attempts (../)
.IP \(bu 4
Shell command blocking (bash, sh, zsh, etc.)
.IP \(bu 4
Dangerous command detection with user confirmation prompts

.SS Shell Enhancement Security
sudosh provides bash/zsh-like shell enhancements with comprehensive security validation:
.IP \(bu 4
.B Alias Security
- Alias names must be valid identifiers (alphanumeric and underscore only)
- Comprehensive validation prevents dangerous aliases containing \fBsudo\fR, \fBrm -rf\fR, environment manipulation
- Critical command override protection blocks aliasing of \fBsudo\fR, \fBpasswd\fR, \fBsu\fR, \fBchmod\fR, etc.
- Environment manipulation detection blocks \fBPATH=\fR, \fBLD_PRELOAD=\fR, \fBexport PATH\fR patterns
- Recursive alias detection prevents self-referential and infinite loop aliases
- Expansion safety testing validates alias expansion before allowing creation
- Shell RC integration safely imports aliases from \fI.bashrc\fR, \fI.zshrc\fR with validation
- Dangerous location blocking prevents execution from \fI/tmp/\fR, \fI~/.hidden\fR, \fI/dev/shm/\fR
- Aliases are stored securely in the user's home directory
.IP \(bu 4
.B Redirection Security
- Safe directory validation only allows redirection to \fI/tmp/\fR, \fI/var/tmp/\fR, home directories
- System directory protection blocks redirection to \fI/etc/\fR, \fI/usr/\fR, \fI/bin/\fR, \fI/sbin/\fR, \fI/var/log/\fR, \fI/opt/\fR, \fI/lib/\fR
- Enhanced error messages provide specific feedback for each blocked directory type:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fI/bin/\fR → "Redirection to system binaries directory (/bin/) is not allowed for security reasons"
.IP \(bu 2
\fI/etc/\fR → "Redirection to system configuration directory (/etc/) is not allowed for security reasons"
.IP \(bu 2
\fI/var/log/\fR → "Redirection to system log directory (/var/log/) is not allowed for security reasons"
.RE
- Pipeline redirection integration ensures redirection security applies to complex pipelines
- Comprehensive audit logging tracks all redirection operations
.IP \(bu 4
.B Environment Variable Security
- Only whitelisted environment variables can be modified (EDITOR, PAGER, LANG, etc.)
- Critical variables like PATH, LD_PRELOAD, SHELL are protected from modification
- All sudo-related variables (SUDO_USER, SUDO_UID, etc.) are read-only
.IP \(bu 4
.B Directory Stack Security
- Directory changes are validated using standard system calls
- No special path traversal protections needed as chdir() handles validation
- Stack depth is limited to prevent memory exhaustion
.IP \(bu 4
.B Command Information Security
- which and type commands use secure PATH resolution
- No execution of external programs for command lookup
- Built-in commands and aliases are identified safely

.SS Intelligent Gut Check Commands
sudosh implements intelligent "gut check" warnings that distinguish between safe and dangerous operations. The system now intelligently analyzes commands to reduce false positives while maintaining security:

.B Safe Read-Only Operations (No Warning):
.IP \(bu 4
.B cat, head, tail
- File viewing commands on system files
.IP \(bu 4
.B less, more, most, pg
- Pagers with security restrictions (shell escapes disabled)
.IP \(bu 4
.B ls, find, locate, grep
- File listing and searching commands
.IP \(bu 4
.B ps, top, htop, id, whoami, date, uptime
- System information commands

.B Blocked Commands (Security Risk):
.IP \(bu 4
.B Interactive editors: vi, vim, emacs, nano
- Can execute shell commands and bypass security (use sudoedit instead)
.IP \(bu 4
.B Shell commands: bash, sh, zsh, csh
- Direct shell access is not permitted
.IP \(bu 4
.B Dangerous shell operations: ;, &&, ||, &, `cmd`, $(cmd)
- Command chaining, logical operators, background execution, and command substitution are blocked for security

.B Dangerous Operations (Blocked with Enhanced Error Messages):
.IP \(bu 4
.B Redirection to system directories
- Redirection to system directories is blocked with specific error messages:
.nf
sudosh:/home/user# echo "test" > /bin/malicious
sudosh: Redirection to system binaries directory (/bin/) is not allowed for security reasons
sudosh: Safe redirection targets: /tmp/, /var/tmp/, or your home directory

sudosh:/home/user# echo "data" > /etc/config
sudosh: Redirection to system configuration directory (/etc/) is not allowed for security reasons
sudosh: Safe redirection targets: /tmp/, /var/tmp/, or your home directory

sudosh:/home/user# echo "log" >> /var/log/system.log
sudosh: Redirection to system log directory (/var/log/) is not allowed for security reasons
sudosh: Safe redirection targets: /tmp/, /var/tmp/, or your home directory
.fi
.IP \(bu 4
.B Dangerous alias creation
- Alias creation is blocked with specific error messages:
.nf
sudosh:/home/user# alias sudo='ls'
sudosh: Alias contains dangerous command 'sudo' and is not allowed

sudosh:/home/user# alias setpath='PATH=/tmp:$PATH'
sudosh: Alias contains environment manipulation and is not allowed
.fi

.B Dangerous System Commands:
.IP \(bu 4
.B init, shutdown, halt, reboot, poweroff
- System control commands
.IP \(bu 4
.B systemctl poweroff, systemctl reboot, systemctl halt
- Systemd power management
.IP \(bu 4
.B systemctl emergency, systemctl rescue
- Emergency system modes

.B Dangerous Command Flags:
.IP \(bu 4
.B rm -rf, rm -R
- Recursive file removal
.IP \(bu 4
.B chmod -R, chmod --recursive
- Recursive permission changes
.IP \(bu 4
.B chown -R, chown --recursive
- Recursive ownership changes
.IP \(bu 4
.B chgrp -R, chgrp --recursive
- Recursive group changes

.B Critical System Directory Access:
.IP \(bu 4
.B /dev/*
- Device files and hardware interfaces
.IP \(bu 4
.B /proc/*
- Process and kernel information
.IP \(bu 4
.B /sys/*
- System and kernel parameters

When these commands are detected, sudosh displays a simplified warning message and prompts for confirmation with "y/N" before proceeding. Users with ALL commands in their sudoers configuration will skip warnings but all commands are still logged for audit purposes.

.B Archive Extraction Safety:
.IP \(bu 4
.B tar -x, unzip, gunzip, bunzip2
- Archive extraction commands that may overwrite files
.IP \(bu 4
.B Extraction to system directories
- Operations targeting /etc, /usr, /var, or other critical paths
.IP \(bu 4
.B Dangerous extraction flags
- Commands with --overwrite, --force, or similar destructive options

This helps prevent accidental execution of potentially destructive operations while reducing warning fatigue for experienced administrators.

.B Secure Pager Execution:
Pagers like \fBless\fR, \fBmore\fR, \fBmost\fR, and \fBpg\fR are allowed to run but with security restrictions to prevent shell escapes:
.IP \(bu 4
Shell command execution is disabled (LESSSECURE=1)
.IP \(bu 4
Editor spawning is prevented (EDITOR=/bin/false, VISUAL=/bin/false)
.IP \(bu 4
Shell access is blocked (SHELL=/bin/false)
.IP \(bu 4
Dangerous environment variables are cleared or overridden
.IP \(bu 4
All pager usage is logged for security auditing

.B CVE Vulnerability Protection:
Sudosh has been audited against major bash CVE vulnerabilities and implements specific protections:
.IP \(bu 4

.nf
username : TTY=tty ; PWD=directory ; USER=root ; COMMAND=command
.fi

.SH COLOR SUPPORT
sudosh automatically inherits and applies colors from the calling shell's environment to provide a familiar user experience.

.SS Automatic Color Detection
sudosh detects terminal color capabilities by examining:
.IP \(bu 4
.B TERM
environment variable (e.g., xterm-256color, screen, tmux)
.IP \(bu 4
.B COLORTERM
environment variable (e.g., truecolor, 24bit)
.IP \(bu 4
TTY status to ensure colors are only applied to interactive terminals

.SS PS1 Color Inheritance
Colors are extracted from the calling shell's PS1 environment variable:
.IP \(bu 4
Supports standard bash color formats: \\[\\033[...m\\]
.IP \(bu 4
Supports alternative formats: \\[\\e[...m\\]
.IP \(bu 4
Applies colors to username, hostname, and path components
.IP \(bu 4
Maintains color consistency with the original shell prompt

.SS Environment Preservation
Color-related environment variables are preserved during security sanitization:
.IP \(bu 4
PS1 (shell prompt with color codes)
.IP \(bu 4
TERM (terminal type)
.IP \(bu 4
COLORTERM (color capability indicator)
.IP \(bu 4
LS_COLORS (directory listing colors)
.IP \(bu 4
GREP_COLORS (grep output colors)

.SS Graceful Fallback
When colors are not supported or detected:
.IP \(bu 4
Falls back to plain text prompt
.IP \(bu 4
Maintains full functionality without colors
.IP \(bu 4
No error messages or warnings displayed

.SH CONFIGURATION
sudosh uses the system's PAM configuration. It attempts to use the "sudo" PAM service, which typically inherits from the system authentication configuration.

On systems without PAM support, sudosh falls back to mock authentication for demonstration purposes.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/pam.d/sudo
PAM configuration file used by sudosh
.TP
.I /etc/group
Group membership file (wheel/sudo groups)
.TP
.I /var/log/auth.log
Authentication log file (Debian/Ubuntu)
.TP
.I /var/log/secure
Security log file (Red Hat/CentOS)

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success
.TP
.B 1
General failure
.TP
.B 2
Authentication failure
.TP
.B 127
Command not found

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.IP \(bu 4
sudosh should only be used in trusted environments
.IP \(bu 4
Regular security audits are recommended
.IP \(bu 4
Monitor logs for suspicious activity
.IP \(bu 4
Keep the system and dependencies updated
.IP \(bu 4
The binary must be installed with setuid root permissions for production use

.SH INSTALLATION
To install sudosh with proper permissions:
.nf
make
sudo make install
.fi

This installs the binary to /usr/local/bin/sudosh with setuid root permissions
and automatically creates a sudo -> sudosh symlink to enable intelligent shell
redirection when users run shell commands through sudo.

.SH VIEWING LOGS
To view sudosh logs:
.nf
# On systems with journald
sudo journalctl -t sudosh

# On systems with traditional syslog
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/secure
.fi

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.SS Permission Denied
Ensure sudosh is installed with setuid root:
.nf
ls -l /usr/local/bin/sudosh
# Should show: -rwsr-xr-x ... root root ... sudosh
.fi

.SS Authentication Issues
Check PAM configuration:
.nf
ls /etc/pam.d/sudo
.fi

.SS User Not in Sudoers
Add user to appropriate group:
.nf
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo usermod -aG sudo username

# Red Hat/CentOS
sudo usermod -aG wheel username
.fi
