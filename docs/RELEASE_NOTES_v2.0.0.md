# Sudosh v2.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Major Version**: 2.0.0  
**Codename**: "Intelligent Security"

## 🎉 **Welcome to Sudosh v2.0!**

Sudosh v2.0 represents a major milestone in secure shell technology, introducing intelligent automation handling, comprehensive user education, and enhanced security controls while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

## 🚀 **Major New Features**

### **1. Intelligent Shell Redirection**
**Revolutionary sudo alias handling for seamless user experience**

When sudosh is aliased to `sudo`, users attempting shell commands now receive educational guidance instead of rejection:

```bash
$ sudo bash
sudosh: redirecting 'bash' to secure interactive shell
sudosh: provides enhanced logging and security controls
sudosh: see 'man sudosh' for details, 'help' for commands

sudosh:/home/user#
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Eliminates user frustration** with helpful explanations
- ✅ **Maintains security** while improving usability
- ✅ **Educational approach** builds security awareness
- ✅ **Complete audit trail** of all redirection attempts

### **2. Enhanced Rules Command**
**Comprehensive command execution information at your fingertips**

The `rules` command now provides complete visibility into your command execution environment:

```bash
sudosh:/home/user# rules

Sudo privileges for user on hostname:
=====================================
[... detailed sudo rules and sources ...]

Always Safe Commands (No sudo required):
=======================================
These commands can always be executed without special permissions:

System Information:
  ls, pwd, whoami, id, date, uptime, w, who

Text Processing:
  grep, egrep, fgrep, sed, awk, cut, sort, uniq
  head, tail, wc, cat, echo

Notes:
• These commands are always allowed regardless of sudo configuration
• Text processing commands support quotes, field references ($1, $2), and patterns
• Safe redirection to /tmp/, /var/tmp/, and home directories is allowed
• Dangerous operations (system() calls, shell escapes) are still blocked

Always Blocked Commands (Security Protection):
==============================================
These commands are blocked for security reasons:

System Control:
  init, shutdown, halt, reboot, poweroff, telinit
  systemctl poweroff/reboot/halt/emergency/rescue

[... additional categories with explanations ...]
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Complete transparency** of command execution rules
- ✅ **Educational content** explains security boundaries
- ✅ **Organized presentation** with clear categorization
- ✅ **Pager support** for long output

### **3. Advanced Text Processing Support**
**Professional-grade awk/sed support with security controls**

Full support for complex text processing operations:

```bash
# Field references and patterns now work seamlessly
sudosh:/home/user# echo hello world | awk '{print $1}'
hello

sudosh:/home/user# echo hello | sed 's/hello/hi/'
hi

# Complex pipelines with safe redirection
sudosh:/home/user# ps aux | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort | uniq > /tmp/users.txt

# Secure redirection to safe locations
sudosh:/home/user# cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/:.*$//' | sort > /tmp/usernames.txt
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ **Dangerous operations blocked**: system() calls, shell escapes
- ✅ **Safe redirection only**: /tmp/, /var/tmp/, home directories
- ✅ **Quote handling**: Proper support for quoted patterns and scripts
- ✅ **Pipeline integration**: Works seamlessly with complex command chains
