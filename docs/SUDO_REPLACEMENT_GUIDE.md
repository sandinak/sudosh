# Sudosh as Sudo Replacement - Complete Guide

This guide covers installing and using sudosh as a complete drop-in replacement for sudo, providing enhanced security while maintaining full compatibility.

## Overview

Sudosh can function as a complete replacement for sudo, providing:
- **100% sudo compatibility** - All existing sudo commands work unchanged
- **Enhanced security** - AI detection, dangerous command blocking, comprehensive logging
- **Safe installation** - Automatic backup and restoration capabilities
- **Seamless transition** - No changes needed to existing scripts or workflows

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Sudo Replacement Installation (Recommended)

This method installs sudosh as your system's sudo command:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/sandinak/sudosh.git
cd sudosh
make

# Install as sudo replacement (with 10-second confirmation)
sudo make install-sudo-replacement
```

**What happens:**
1. Your original sudo is backed up to `/usr/bin/sudo.orig`
2. Sudosh is installed as `/usr/bin/sudo`
3. Sudosh is also available as `/usr/bin/sudosh`
4. All existing sudo commands now use sudosh with enhanced security

### Method 2: Standard Installation

Install sudosh alongside existing sudo:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/sandinak/sudosh.git
cd sudosh
make

# Standard installation
sudo make install
```

This installs sudosh as `/usr/bin/sudosh` without replacing sudo.

## Usage Examples

### Command-Line Execution (Sudo Compatible)

Once installed as sudo replacement, all these work exactly as before:

```bash
# Basic command execution
sudo echo "Hello World"

# Package management
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo yum install package-name

# Service management
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status apache2

# File operations
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.backup
sudo chown user:group /path/to/file

# User specification
sudo -u www-data ls /var/www
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT version();"

# Command mode
sudo -c "systemctl restart nginx && systemctl status nginx"

# List privileges
sudo -l

# Validate credentials
sudo -v
```

### Interactive Shell Mode

Start an interactive privileged shell:

```bash
# Start interactive shell
sudo sudosh

# Or if not installed as replacement
sudosh
```

### Enhanced Security Features

All sudo commands now include:

```bash
# AI detection (blocks AI-assisted commands)
sudo echo "This will be blocked if run from AI tools"

# Dangerous command protection
sudo rm -rf /  # Will prompt for confirmation

# Comprehensive logging
sudo any-command  # Logged to syslog with full context
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable test mode (for development)
export SUDOSH_TEST_MODE=1

# CI/CD environments
export CI=true  # Disables interactive prompts
```

### Ansible Integration

Sudosh automatically detects Ansible sessions:

```bash
# Ansible playbooks work seamlessly
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

# Manual Ansible mode
sudo --ansible-force command
```

## Safety and Restoration

### Restore Original Sudo

If you need to restore the original sudo:

```bash
# Restore from backup
sudo make restore-sudo

# Or manually
sudo cp /usr/bin/sudo.orig /usr/bin/sudo
```

### Complete Removal

To completely remove sudosh and restore original sudo:

```bash
# Remove sudo replacement and restore original
sudo make uninstall-sudo-replacement
```

### Backup Verification

Check if backup exists:

```bash
# Verify backup
ls -la /usr/bin/sudo*

# Should show:
# /usr/bin/sudo      (sudosh)
# /usr/bin/sudo.orig (original sudo)
# /usr/bin/sudosh    (sudosh)
```

## Testing and Validation

### Test Sudo Compatibility

```bash
# Run comprehensive sudo replacement tests
./tests/test_sudo_replacement.sh

# Test CI/CD compatibility
./tests/test_ci_compatibility.sh

# Run all tests
make test-comprehensive
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check version
sudo --version  # Should show "sudosh"

# Test basic functionality
sudo echo "test"
sudo -l
sudo -u $(whoami) whoami
```

## Migration from Sudo

### For System Administrators

1. **Backup current configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.backup
   ```

2. **Install sudosh as replacement**:
   ```bash
   sudo make install-sudo-replacement
   ```

3. **Test existing workflows**:
   ```bash
   # Test your common sudo commands
   sudo systemctl status
   sudo -u appuser command
   ```

4. **Monitor logs**:
   ```bash
   # Check syslog for sudosh entries
   tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep sudosh
   ```

### For Automation/CI/CD

Sudosh works seamlessly in automated environments:

```bash
# In CI/CD scripts, no changes needed
sudo apt-get update
sudo systemctl restart service
sudo -u deploy ./deploy.sh
```

### For Ansible

No changes required - Ansible automatically works with sudosh:

```yaml
# Ansible playbooks work unchanged
- name: Install package
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  become: yes
```

## Advanced Features

### Enhanced Logging

All commands are logged with additional context:

```bash
# View sudosh logs
journalctl -t sudosh
grep sudosh /var/log/syslog
```

### Security Monitoring

Monitor for security events:

```bash
# Watch for AI detection events
grep "AI.*blocked" /var/log/syslog

# Monitor dangerous commands
grep "dangerous.*command" /var/log/syslog
```

### Performance Monitoring

Check sudosh performance:

```bash
# Time command execution
time sudo echo "performance test"

# Monitor resource usage
top -p $(pgrep sudosh)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied after installation**:
   ```bash
   # Check sudosh permissions
   ls -la /usr/bin/sudo
   # Should show: -rwsr-xr-x root root
   
   # Fix if needed
   sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
   ```

2. **Original sudo not backed up**:
   ```bash
   # Check for backup
   ls -la /usr/bin/sudo.orig
   
   # If missing, reinstall sudo package
   apt-get install --reinstall sudo
   ```

3. **Sudoers file issues**:
   ```bash
   # Test sudoers syntax
   sudo visudo -c
   
   # Restore from backup if needed
   sudo cp /etc/sudoers.backup /etc/sudoers
   ```

### Emergency Recovery

If sudosh causes issues:

1. **Boot to recovery mode**
2. **Mount filesystem as read-write**
3. **Restore original sudo**:
   ```bash
   cp /usr/bin/sudo.orig /usr/bin/sudo
   ```
