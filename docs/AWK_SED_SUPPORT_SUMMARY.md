# awk and sed Support Enhancement Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED: awk and sed now work the same way as grep**

### **Problem Solved**
Previously, `awk` and `sed` were partially supported but had significant limitations:
- ✗ `$` character was blocked, preventing awk field references like `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- ✗ Quotes were blocked, preventing sed patterns and awk scripts
- ✗ `echo` was not whitelisted for pipeline use, limiting common patterns
- ✗ Pipeline validation was too restrictive for text processing commands

### **Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Enhanced Safe Commands List**
**File: `src/security.c`**
- ✅ Added `echo` to safe commands list (lines 500-501)
- ✅ Confirmed `awk`, `gawk`, and `sed` are in safe commands list
- ✅ All text processing commands now have consistent treatment

#### **2. Enhanced Pipeline Whitelist**
**File: `src/pipeline.c`**
- ✅ Added `echo` to whitelisted pipeline commands (line 20)
- ✅ Enables common patterns like `echo data | awk '{print $1}'`

#### **3. Fixed Text Processing Command Detection**
**File: `src/security.c` - `validate_command_for_pipeline()` function**
- ✅ Enhanced detection logic to use `is_text_processing_command()` function
- ✅ Properly handles full paths like `/usr/bin/awk`
- ✅ Consistent with main validation logic

#### **4. Fixed Character Restrictions for Pipelines**
**File: `src/security.c` - Main `validate_command()` function**
- ✅ Skip `$` character validation for pipeline commands (line 1195)
- ✅ Skip quote validation for pipeline commands (line 1205)
- ✅ Pipeline-specific validation handles these restrictions appropriately

#### **5. Enhanced Pipeline Validation**
**File: `src/security.c` - `validate_command_for_pipeline()` function**
- ✅ Allow `$` character for text processing commands (awk field references)
- ✅ Allow quotes for text processing commands (sed patterns, awk scripts)
- ✅ Maintain security controls for dangerous operations

### **Technical Changes Made**

#### **Files Modified:**
1. **`src/security.c`**:
   - Added `echo` to safe commands list
   - Enhanced text processing detection in pipeline validation
   - Modified main validation to skip restrictive checks for pipeline commands
   - Updated pipeline validation to allow quotes and `$` for text processing

2. **`src/pipeline.c`**:
   - Added `echo` to whitelisted pipeline commands

#### **Key Code Changes:**

**Enhanced Pipeline Text Processing Detection:**
```c
/* Extract the command name (first word) for text processing detection */
char *cmd_copy = strdup(trim);
char *cmd_name = strtok(cmd_copy, " \t");
int is_text_processing_pipeline = 0;
if (cmd_name && is_text_processing_command(cmd_name)) {
    is_text_processing_pipeline = 1;
}
```

**Pipeline-Aware Main Validation:**
```c
/* Skip this check for pipeline commands as they will be validated by pipeline validator */
if (strchr(command, '$') && !strchr(command, '|')) {
    // ... validation logic
}
```

### **Functionality Verification**

#### **✅ Working Examples:**
```bash
# awk in pipelines with field references
echo hello world | awk '{print $1}'     # Now works!

# sed in pipelines with patterns  
echo hello | sed 's/hello/hi/'          # Now works!

# awk with redirection
echo data | awk 'NF' > /tmp/output.txt  # Now works!

# sed with redirection
echo hello | sed 's/hello/hi/' > /tmp/output.txt  # Now works!
```

#### **🛡️ Security Controls Maintained:**
```bash
# Dangerous awk patterns still blocked
awk 'BEGIN{system("ls")}'               # Still blocked ✓

# Dangerous sed patterns still blocked  
sed 'e ls'                              # Still blocked ✓

# Unsafe redirection still blocked
echo test | awk 'NF' > /etc/passwd      # Still blocked ✓
```

### **Benefits Achieved**

#### **1. Feature Parity with grep**
- ✅ `awk` and `sed` now have the same capabilities as `grep`
- ✅ Standalone execution with security validation
- ✅ Pipeline support with individual command validation
- ✅ Redirection support with safe target validation

#### **2. Enhanced Text Processing Capabilities**
- ✅ Full awk field reference support (`$1`, `$2`, `$NF`, etc.)
- ✅ Complete sed pattern support with quotes
- ✅ Complex text processing pipelines now possible
- ✅ Professional-grade text manipulation workflows

#### **3. Maintained Security**
- ✅ All existing security controls preserved
- ✅ Dangerous operations still blocked appropriately
- ✅ System directory protection maintained
- ✅ Command injection prevention intact

#### **4. Improved User Experience**
- ✅ Common text processing patterns now work as expected
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all text processing tools
- ✅ Reduced user frustration with blocked legitimate operations
- ✅ Enhanced productivity for data analysis tasks

### **Integration Status**

#### **✅ Seamless Integration:**
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ All existing security tests pass
- ✅ New functionality works with existing features:
  - ✅ Alias system integration
  - ✅ Redirection security validation
  - ✅ Pipeline security controls
  - ✅ Audit logging integration

#### **✅ Comprehensive Testing:**
- ✅ Standalone command execution verified
- ✅ Pipeline functionality verified
- ✅ Redirection security verified
- ✅ Dangerous pattern blocking verified
- ✅ Integration with existing features verified

### **Summary**

**MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: `awk` and `sed` now work exactly the same way as `grep` in sudosh:

1. **Full text processing support** with quotes and field references
2. **Complete pipeline integration** with security validation
3. **Safe redirection capabilities** with directory protection
4. **Maintained security controls** for dangerous operations
5. **Seamless integration** with existing sudosh features

The enhancement provides professional-grade text processing capabilities while maintaining sudosh's comprehensive security model. Users can now perform complex data analysis and text manipulation tasks with the same ease and security as basic grep operations.
