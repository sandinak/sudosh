# Sudosh Redirection Parsing Fix

## Problem Statement

The original issue was that redirection operators (`>`, `<`, `>>`) were being treated as command arguments instead of being parsed as shell operators. This caused commands like:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd| grep root > /tmp/foo
```

To fail with:
```
grep: >: No such file or directory
grep: /tmp/foo: No such file or directory
```

The `>` and `/tmp/foo` were being passed as arguments to `grep` instead of being interpreted as output redirection.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `parse_command()` function in `src/command.c`, which used simple `strtok_r()` tokenization that treated all whitespace-separated tokens as command arguments, without recognizing shell operators like redirection.

### Original Problematic Code
```c
/* Tokenize the command */
token = strtok_r(input_copy, " \t\n", &saveptr);
while (token != NULL) {
    /* Store every token as an argument */
    cmd->argv[argc] = expand_equals_expression(token);
    argc++;
    token = strtok_r(NULL, " \t\n", &saveptr);
}
```

This approach couldn't distinguish between:
- `grep pattern file` (normal arguments)
- `grep pattern > file` (redirection operator)

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Command Parsing Architecture

Implemented a multi-layered parsing approach:

1. **Shell Operator Detection**: `contains_shell_operators()` identifies commands with special operators
2. **Operator-Specific Parsing**: Routes commands to appropriate parsers based on operators found
3. **Security Validation**: Integrates with existing security controls
4. **Execution Enhancement**: Handles redirection during command execution
5. **Pipeline Integration**: Enhanced pipeline execution to handle redirection in individual commands

### 2. New Functions Added

#### `contains_shell_operators(const char *input)`
- Detects shell operators: `>`, `<`, `|`, `;`, `&`, `&&`, `||`, `` ` ``, `$()`
- Respects quoted strings (ignores operators inside quotes)
- Returns 1 if operators found, 0 otherwise

#### `parse_command_with_shell_operators(const char *input, struct command_info *cmd)`
- Routes commands based on operator type
- Handles redirection via `parse_command_with_redirection()`
- Blocks dangerous operators (`;`, `&`, `&&`, `||`, `` ` ``, `$()`)
- Redirects pipe operations to pipeline parser

#### `parse_command_with_redirection(const char *input, struct command_info *cmd)`
- Parses redirection syntax: `>`, `>>`, `<`
- Splits command into command part and redirection part
- Validates redirection targets for security
- Stores redirection information in command structure

#### `tokenize_command_line(const char *input, char ***argv, int *argc, int *argv_size)`
- Shell-aware tokenization for command parts
- Handles argument expansion and memory management
- Used by both regular and redirection parsing

#### `trim_whitespace_inplace(char *str)`
- Utility function for cleaning up parsed strings
- Trims leading and trailing whitespace in place

### 3. Enhanced Data Structures

#### Redirection Support in `struct command_info`
```c
typedef enum {
    REDIRECT_NONE = 0,
    REDIRECT_INPUT,
    REDIRECT_OUTPUT,
    REDIRECT_OUTPUT_APPEND
} redirect_type_t;

struct command_info {
    char *command;
    char **argv;
    int argc;
    char **envp;
    /* New redirection fields */
    redirect_type_t redirect_type;
    char *redirect_file;
    int redirect_append;
};
```

### 4. Execution Enhancement

Enhanced both `execute_command()` and `execute_pipeline()` to handle redirection:

**Regular Command Execution:**
```c
/* Handle redirection if specified */
if (cmd->redirect_type != REDIRECT_NONE && cmd->redirect_file) {
    int redirect_fd;

    switch (cmd->redirect_type) {
        case REDIRECT_OUTPUT:
            redirect_fd = open(cmd->redirect_file, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
            dup2(redirect_fd, STDOUT_FILENO);
            break;
        case REDIRECT_OUTPUT_APPEND:
            redirect_fd = open(cmd->redirect_file, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND, 0644);
            dup2(redirect_fd, STDOUT_FILENO);
            break;
        case REDIRECT_INPUT:
            redirect_fd = open(cmd->redirect_file, O_RDONLY);
            dup2(redirect_fd, STDIN_FILENO);
            break;
    }
}
```

**Pipeline Execution Enhancement:**
The key fix was adding redirection handling to `execute_pipeline()` in `src/pipeline.c`. After setting up pipe redirection between commands, the pipeline executor now also checks for and handles file redirection for each individual command in the pipeline.

## Security Integration

### 1. Safe Redirection Validation
- Integrates with existing `validate_safe_redirection()` function
- Only allows redirection to safe directories (`/tmp/`, `/var/tmp/`, `~/`)
- Blocks redirection to system directories (`/etc/`, `/usr/`, `/var/log/`)

### 2. Dangerous Operator Blocking
- Blocks command chaining: `;`, `&&`, `||`
- Blocks background execution: `&`
- Blocks command substitution: `` ` ``, `$()`
- Provides clear error messages for blocked operations

### 3. Pipeline Integration
- Commands with pipes are properly routed to pipeline parser
- Pipeline parser calls enhanced `parse_command()` for individual commands
- Supports complex pipelines with redirection: `cat file | grep pattern > output`

## Testing

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite
- `tests/unit/test_redirection_parsing.c` - 7 test functions
- Tests shell operator detection, redirection parsing, edge cases
- Integration with existing test framework

### 2. Test Coverage
- **Shell operator detection**: Various operators, quoted strings, edge cases
- **Redirection parsing**: Output, append, input redirection
- **Security validation**: Unsafe redirection blocking
- **Integration**: Command structure initialization and cleanup
- **Edge cases**: Malformed input, NULL handling, error conditions

## Examples

### Before the Fix
```bash
# Command: cat /etc/passwd| grep root > /tmp/foo
# Result: grep: >: No such file or directory
#         grep: /tmp/foo: No such file or directory
```

### After the Fix
```bash
# Command: cat /etc/passwd| grep root > /tmp/foo
# Result: [Executes properly, creates /tmp/foo with root entries]
```

### Supported Redirection Types

#### Output Redirection
```bash
echo "test" > /tmp/output.txt          # Creates/overwrites file
ls -la > /tmp/listing.txt              # Redirects stdout to file
```

#### Append Redirection
```bash
echo "more data" >> /tmp/output.txt    # Appends to file
date >> /tmp/log.txt                   # Appends timestamp
```

#### Input Redirection
```bash
sort < /tmp/unsorted.txt               # Reads from file
wc -l < /etc/passwd                    # Counts lines from file
```

#### Pipeline with Redirection
```bash
ps aux | grep bash > /tmp/bash_procs.txt    # Pipeline with output redirection
cat file | sort | uniq > /tmp/unique.txt    # Complex pipeline with redirection
```

- **Memory efficient**: Reuses existing command structure
- **No impact on simple commands**: Zero overhead for commands without operators

## Backward Compatibility

- **Existing commands continue to work**: No breaking changes
- **Enhanced functionality**: Adds redirection support without affecting existing behavior
- **Security maintained**: All existing security controls remain active
- **Pipeline integration**: Works seamlessly with existing pipeline functionality

## Security Benefits

1. **Proper operator parsing**: Prevents misinterpretation of shell operators
2. **Safe redirection validation**: Maintains existing redirection security
3. **Dangerous operator blocking**: Prevents command injection through operators
4. **Audit trail preservation**: All redirection operations are logged
5. **Integration with existing controls**: Works with NSS, pipeline, and text processing security

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Advanced redirection**: Support for `2>`, `&>`, `<>`
- **Here documents**: Support for `<<` operator
- **Process substitution**: Support for `<()` and `>()`
- **Redirection validation**: More granular control over redirection targets

## Summary

This fix resolves the core issue where redirection operators were treated as command arguments, implementing proper shell syntax parsing while maintaining security and backward compatibility. The solution:

- ✅ **Fixes the original issue**: `cat /etc/passwd| grep root > /tmp/foo` now works correctly
- ✅ **Maintains security**: All existing security controls remain active
- ✅ **Preserves compatibility**: Existing commands continue to work unchanged
- ✅ **Adds comprehensive testing**: Full test coverage for new functionality
- ✅ **Integrates seamlessly**: Works with pipelines, aliases, and other features
- ✅ **Provides clear feedback**: Helpful error messages for blocked operations

The implementation follows sudosh's security-first approach while significantly improving shell operator handling and user experience.
